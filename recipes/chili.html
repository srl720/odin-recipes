        <h2>Texas Chili Recipe</h2>
        <p>Texas chili creates controversy anytime it's discussed. There are purists who will lose their collective minds at the mention of beans being allowed in chili. I'm in the camp that loves the addition of beans. Beans aren't just a filler, but add a great taste as well. This recipe, however, will focus on traditional Texas chili in the Meat Church style, made popular by owner Matt Pittman.</p>
        <p>Skipping the beans calls for the welcome addition of more meat. You can use extra ground beef or breakfast sausage if you'd like. I'll use smoked chuck roast in this example. Tweak the recipe to find your preference, even adding the beans if you see fit. Proceed with caution, as extra meat and beans will compete for space in the pot.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef 2 lbs</li>
            <li>Chuck Roast 1 lbs</li>
            <li>Breakfast Sausage 1 lbs</li>
            <li>Red Onion, 3 med</li>
            <li>Garlic, 1 head minced</li>
            <li>Crushed Tomatoes with juice, 2 28oz cans</li>
            <li>Italian Style Diced Tomatoes with juice, 1 28oz can</li>
            <li>Chipotle in Adobo Sauce, 1 28oz can, reserve juice</li>
            <li>Meat Church Chili Seasoning, 6 T</li>
            <li>Beer or Beef broth, 12oz</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil to a very large skillet. Matt prefers cast iron. Sauté the onions, garlic and adobo peppers (including all the liquid from the can). This is a lot of onion, so you may have to cook in 2 batches if you don’t have a really large skillet. Cook for about 10 minutes until the onions are translucent. Remove from skillet and place the mixture in your slow cooker or dutch oven</li>
<li>Dice the chuck roast into small pieces. Brown the meat in the same skillet. We are going to simmer this chili all day so you just need to brown it and get some char on the outside. Remove from skillet and place the meat in your slow cooker or dutch oven.</li>
<li>Cook the ground meat and breakfast sausage completely in the same skillet. Drain the fat and place all of the meat in the slow cooker or dutch oven.</li>
<li>By this time you already have the meat, onions, garlic and adobo peppers in your slow cooker or dutch oven. Now add the 3 cans of tomatoes with the juice, 1 beer and 6 T of Meat Church Texas Chili Seasoning. Mix thoroughly. </li>
<li>The ingredients are already cooked at this point, but we will simmer this chili all day to break down the meat and meld the flavors together. If you are using a slow cooker you can run this 6 - 8 hours on low. Stir it periodically throughout the day if you can. If you want to smoke this chili you can run it at 250 degrees in a smoker or pellet grill for 6-8 hours. I leave the lid off for 4-5 hours stirring on the hour. I cover the last couple hours. </li>
        </ol>
