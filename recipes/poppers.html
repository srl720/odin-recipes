        <h2>Smoked Jalapeno Poppers</h2>
        <p>Grill lovers often have their go-to appetizer that's a combination of price and cooking ease. Poppers seem to top these lists for several reasons. They aren't labor insensive have a relatively short prep and smoke time.</p>
        <p>This recipe keeps it simple by ommitting meats aside from bacon. Add your own touches with cooked ground meats or sausage pieces mixed into the cheese mixture. I skipped out on the extras for price and time related reasons. Sometimes you just want a cheap crowd pleaser.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 Jalapenos, halved</li>
            <li>Thick cut Bacon, 10 pieces cut in half</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese, 8 oz</li>
            <li>Cheddar Cheese, 8 oz</li>
            <li>BBQ Dry Rub of your choice, 2 T for cheese mixture, 2 T for topping</li></ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut jalapenos lengthwise and remove seeds and membranes. Leaving these intact will increase heat levels</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and 2 T or more of dry rub. Add cooked meats in this step if desired.</li>
        <li>Spoon cheese mixture into jalapeno halves. Try not to overfill as it will seep out of bacon during cooking</li>
        <li>Wrap halves with bacon. Sprinkle dry rub over bacon. Use as much as you'd like.</li>

    </ol>
